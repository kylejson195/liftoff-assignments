## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet generator and general playing aid. Typically, there is a lot of dice rolling and math associated with playing a game of DnD, and the complexity can be offputting to new players. This app will simplify the character creation process by streamlining the technical aspects of making a new adventurer. The sheet will be fully customizable, though there will be suggestions and default settings in the databases for things like Name, Character Class, and Race.
